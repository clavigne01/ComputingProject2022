### Description
Caileigh Lavigne, Dereck Jernigan, and Ben Hudgens, will be writing a program that will monitor the pH of a reaction, while calculating the pKa, Ka, and the concentration of the unknown solution. 

## Dereck J:

I have added a table to R Markdown, eventually the coded equations will be inserted into the table for organization.


## Caileigh Lavigne
I have located the pH meter that will be used for this project. I have also began looking at material that will help me better understand how to communicate with the pH meter, as well as receive its output data.


```{r}
pHdata <- read.table("_____",header = TRUE)
pHdata <- read.table(header=TRUE, text="
Unknown     pH     pKa     pOH     Concentration
1            0      0       0          0
2            0      0       0          0
3            0      0       0          0
4            0      0       0          0
5            0      0       0          0"
)
```
