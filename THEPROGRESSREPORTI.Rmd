### Description
Caileigh Lavigne, Dereck Jernigan, and Ben Hudgens, will be writing a program that will monitor the pH of a reaction, while calculating the pKa, Ka, and the concentration of the unknown solution. 

## Dereck J:

I have added a table to R Markdown, eventually the coded equations will be inserted into the table for organization.


## Caileigh Lavigne
I have located the pH meter that will be used for this project. I have also began looking at material that will help me better understand how to communicate with the pH meter, as well as receive its output data.


```{python}
from prettytable import PrettyTable


# Specify the Column Names while initializing the Table
myTable = PrettyTable(["Unknown", "pH", "pOH", "pKa", "Concentration"])

# Add rows
myTable.add_row(["1", "0", "0", "0", "0"])
myTable.add_row(["2", "0", "0", "0", "0"])
myTable.add_row(["3", "0", "0", "0", "0"])
myTable.add_row(["4", "0", "0", "0", "0"])
myTable.add_row(["5", "0", "0", "0", "0"])
myTable.add_row(["6", "0", "0", "0", "0"])
myTable.add_row(["7", "0", "0", "0", "0"])

print(myTable)

```
