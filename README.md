Caileigh:
I will be writing a program that will send output to a pH meter and receive the data from the pH meter. The program will tell the pH meter to read the pH given a specific volume of titrate, then the pH meter will send the data to the computer for data gathering.

Dereck:
I will be creating the csv file to gather and tabulate the data.  This is the 'data gathering' portion of Caileigh's response.

Ben:
I will be coding the portion that interprets the data from the tables generated to visualize the pH change over time and also code the equations that will convert the pH to other relevent data values
