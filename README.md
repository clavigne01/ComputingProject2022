Caileigh:
I will be writing a program that will send output to a pH meter and receive the data from the pH meter. The program will tell the pH meter to read the pH given a specific volume of titrate, then the pH meter will send the data to the computer for data gathering.

Dereck:
I will be coding the tables that will organize the data that is recieved from the pH meter.  This is the 'data gathering' portion of Caileigh's response.
